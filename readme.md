# Neural network for DNA sequences

- Original project Fall 2019-2020 on machine learning methods from DNA sequences in `ml-methods` folder: logistic regression, SVMs, RFs
- Preliminary results from R01 submissions on neural network models from DNA sequences or images in `nn-methods` folder.


## Where we are and next steps

- We have preliminary results of fitting naive NN models (in Julia) on Pseudomonas sequence data in `nn-methods` folder. See `notebook.md` [here](https://github.com/solislemuslab/dna-nn/blob/master/notebook.md#neural-network-models)
- We have improved results on better NN models for sequence data:
    - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05995)
    - [Github repo](https://github.com/solislemuslab/dna-nn-theory) in python
- We want to use the new models identified in the paper to the Pseudomonas data
