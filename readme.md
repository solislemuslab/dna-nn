# Neural network for DNA sequences

- Original project Fall 2019-2020 on machine learning methods from DNA sequences in `ml-methods` folder: logistic regression, SVMs, RFs
- Preliminary results from R01 submissions on neural network models from DNA sequences or images in `nn-methods` folder. See `notebook.md` [here](https://github.com/solislemuslab/dna-nn/blob/master/notebook.md#neural-network-models) for a summary on Pseudomonas only.
- New work by Yuren Sun on prediction of antibiotic resistance from genomic data for Pseudomonas in `nn-methods/yuren`. We are using our new knowledge based on our [NN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05995) and [accompanying github repo](https://github.com/solislemuslab/dna-nn-theory)
    - Binary classification [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/solislemuslab/dna-nn/blob/master/nn-methods/yuren/binary-classification-description.ipynb)
    - Regression [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/solislemuslab/dna-nn/blob/master/nn-methods/yuren/regression-description.ipynb)
